Publication and ordering details can be found at
<http://icls.sas.ac.uk/publications>. The font is also used in the
online catalogue of stamps derived from the published volumes at
<http://www.rgzm.de/samian>.

The font contains a range of standard characters (upper- and lower-case, digits
and punctuation). The special ligatures and symbols for sigillata stamps are in
the Unicode Private Use area starting at position 0xF500. This font was
developed from 2008 until the final volume of *Names on terra sigillata* was
published in June 2012.

Some glyphs in Samian5 are based on [Bitstream
Vera](http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html)
and [DejaVu](http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/) fonts. See the included
LICENSE-dejavu for the original licensing of DejaVu and Vera fonts.
Samian5 was developed using
[fontforge](http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/).

The font is distributed as a .ttf (TrueType) file that should be
installable on most systems.  An installation program for the Windows
operating systems is also available, but installation through the .ttf
is recommended in most cases.

A brief introduction to the use of Samian5 is included in the
*Illustrating Samian Ware* guidelines of the Study Group for Roman
Pottery, available on line at
<http://romanpotterystudy.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Illustrating_Samian_Ware.pdf>
