The font is also used in the online catalogue of stamps derived from the
published volumes at <http://www.rgzm.de/samian>

The font contains a range of standard characters (upper- and lower-case, digits
and punctuation). The special ligatures and symbols for sigillata stamps are in
the Unicode Private Use area starting at position 0xF500. This font was 
developed from 2008 until the final volume of *Names on terra sigillata* was
published in June 2012.

Some glyphs in Samian5 are based on [Bitstream
Vera](http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html)
and [DejaVu](http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/) fonts. See the included
LICENSE-dejavu for the original licensing of DejaVu and Vera fonts.

Samian5 was developed using [fontforge](http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/).

The latest version of the font can be downloaded from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/samian5/>
